# Spatial Collaboration: The "Campfire" Protocol

> *"Meetings are not grids of faces staring at you. Meetings are people gathered around a fire, looking at the same thing."*

## 1. The Core Concept: "Playful Presence"
In traditional tools (Zoom, Teams), users are fixed in a rigid grid. In SpatialOS, collaboration is an act of **arrangement**. People are not windows; they are **"Pieces"** on your board.

You don't "join a call." You **open a Clearing**.

## 2. The Meeting Place ("The Clearing")

The **Meeting Place** is a specialized District that can be toggled visible or invisible. It is not a separate app; it is a "layer" that descends onto your current workspace.

### The Artifact-Centric Model
Most calls are about *something*—a document, a design, a bug.
- **The Ground**: The center of the meeting is the floor.
- **The Totem**: You drag the subject of discussion (e.g., the `Arc Browser` node or a `Stack` of images) into the center of the Clearing.
- **The Perspective**: Instead of looking face-to-face, the default view is **"Looking Down"** (God-view) or **"Looking In"** (Circle view) at the Totem on the ground. We look *at the work together*, not just at each other.

## 3. "People Pieces": Participants as Objects

Every participant in the call is represented as a spatial node (Avatar or Live Video Bubble).

### Arrangeable Humanity
You have full agency over how you perceive your team.
- **The Huddle**: Drag the Engineer and the Designer closer to the `Code Node` because they are debating it.
- **The Gallery**: Push the Manager to the periphery (muted/observing) while you focus on the active contributors.
- **The Stage**: Drag the Keynote Speaker to the top-center, making them larger than everyone else.

### The Self-Piece ("The Mirror")
Your own video feed is just another object.
- It is not stuck in the corner.
- You can pick yourself up and place yourself next to the person you are agreeing with.
- **Gesture**: Shake your own video node to "wave" or get attention.

## 4. Automations vs. Freeform Play

While "everything is a piece to play with," we provide **"Norms"** (templates) to quickly organize chaos.

### A. "The Campfire" (Default)
- **Behavior**: Participants automatically arrange in a perfect circle around the central Totem.
- **Automation**: As new people join, the circle expands breathing-room automatically.

### B. "The Spotlight" (Speaker Centric)
- **Behavior**: The physics of the room change. The "Active Speaker" is magnetically pulled to the Center Stage.
- **Transition**: When someone else starts talking, they gently float to the center, pushing the previous speaker back to the circle's edge.

### C. "The War Room" (Freeform)
- **Behavior**: No physics. Total manual control.
- **Use Case**: You group people by department (Engineering cluster on the left, Design cluster on the right) around different artifacts.

## 5. Perspectives & The "Ground"

The interface supports shifting the dimension of the meeting.

### 2D Mode (The Map)
Standard SpatialOS view. We are looking down at cards on a table. Good for planning and high-level strategy.

### 2.5D Mode (The Diorama)
The interface tilts back. The "Ground" becomes a floor.
- The **Totem** stands up (e.g., a 3D model or vertical whiteboard).
- **People Pieces** stand around it like figures in a diorama.
- You can rotate the entire "room" to see who is standing behind the object or whispering in the corner.

## 6. Micro-Interactions
- **Proximity Volume**: Dragging a person's node away from the center lowers their volume (Spatial Audio).
- **Passing the Mic**: Literally dragging a "Microphone Node" to another person to give them the floor.
- **Gaze Lines**: Faint lines connect a person's video bubble to the object they are currently interacting with (hovering), so you know what they are looking at.
